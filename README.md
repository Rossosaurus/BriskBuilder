## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

<h3 align="center"><b>This program is in it's infancy and currently only has very basic functionality. See TODO.md to see my current plans for this program.</b></h3>

Want to be able to build projects with a compiler quickly but hate using visual studio because it's clunky and takes up too much space? Presenting Brisk Builder a small program written in Python to build projects at the click of a button.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

I'm not at a stage with this project where I actually need to build the project into an exe so I don't have a "this is the way to do it" method yet. It's a simple program written in python though so just clone the repo and run `main.py` in python.

### Prerequisites

- PyQt5

### Installing

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

I'll write this section when the program has more functionality. Until then you'll have to figure out how to use this yourself. Not that there's much to figure out, it's fairly self explanatory.
